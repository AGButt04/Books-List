# 📚 Library Book List Manager

A desktop library management application built with Java Swing featuring a modern UI for managing personal book collections. Provides full CRUD operations with input validation and confirmation dialogs for a professional user experience.

## 🎯 What I Built
- **Book Collection Manager**: Add, edit, and remove books from a personal library
- **Modern UI Design**: Clean interface with emoji icons and professional styling
- **Input Validation**: Error handling for empty entries and invalid operations
- **User Confirmation**: Dialog confirmations for destructive actions (delete operations)
- **Responsive Layout**: Scalable interface with proper component spacing and borders

## ✨ Key Features
- ➕ **Add Books**: Create new book entries with author and title information
- ✏️ **Edit Entries**: Modify existing book information with pre-populated fields
- 🗑️ **Remove Books**: Delete selected books with confirmation dialog
- 📋 **List Display**: Scrollable list view with proper selection highlighting
- ⚠️ **Input Validation**: Error messages for empty inputs and invalid selections
- 🎨 **Modern Styling**: System look-and-feel with custom fonts and spacing

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
```
src/
├── JListExample.java     # Main application class with GUI and event handling
